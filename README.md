Gesture-Controlled-Black-Board
==============================

In university restaurants and cafeteria students use bulletin boards in order to announce offers and to get a look on other offerings regarding used books, furniture, cars and apartments. The infrastructure doesn't support possibilities of internet technologies and paradigms such as web2.0. The Physical and Electronic Bulletin Board provides a public interactive screen, which can be used in different ways. In our version, we have integrated a number of features. This version has a slideshow. The images were placed on a Dropbox server. If an image is uploaded, it has been integrated into the running slideshow without closing the program. You could add different formats in the slideshow, such as PDF, JPG and GIF images. In addition, the PC was set for a certain time in the sleep mode to save the power costs. According the user questionnaire, the users wish more interactivity. The Kinect was proposed. But this version works with batch files, and there is no possibility to program the Kinect, so we had to change the system. The programming language C# has been taken as basis.
